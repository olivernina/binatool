Documentation
This is a very initial documentation

There are a few dependencies in the code with other libraries mainly:
GNU Scientific library
OpenCV
CVTLib (which is included with the code but need to be setup as an external library)

This code has been built and tried with VisualStudio 2008


To setup CVTLib make sure the path to the project is correct in your project properties
Check the path in Properties->C/C_++ the paths to all projects mention above should be correct
This is required for the Lu and Su algorithm. For the Nina algorithm everything should be included already


For now I am including all files for VS but you should be able to recompile and rebuild the project 
if you fix all the depencencies

Let me know if you have problems.
