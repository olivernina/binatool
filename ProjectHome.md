This is a page created for releasing source code for state of the art binarization methods as described in our FHTW 2013 paper.

The code uses the OpenCV libraries and Gnu scientific library
You can browse or checkout the code by clicking on the Source link.
Please feel free to report any problems or give any feedback.

The license of the code is free for research and educational purposes. If you would like to use it for commercial purposes please contact Oliver Nina at:
olivernina at gmail dot com


you can download the code and executables through SVN on the google code server and the link provided in the source tab.

there is an executables folder that contains just the executables in case you just want to run the code and don't need the code. The python gui code is from an older version and right now is not working with the algorithms reported on the FHTW paper. Look at the readme file in the executables folder to see how to run the executables of each algorithm.

Please cite our work if you use our work to publish a paper.
